# **RPS-with-GUI**
## About
This game was created in late 2021 by Varun Iyer. The only changes made since were to the file structure and updates to file paths, and updates to the README. The goal of this project is for some introductory learning about Python and GUIs. <br><br>
This game allows the user to select a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will then pseudo-randomly choose one of the three, and the result will be displayed. The previous choice for both parties is also displayed, and the running score for both sides, rounds played, and ties, are also shown.

## How to Play
To play, clone the respository and run ```rps.py``` on a *Windows* computer.
